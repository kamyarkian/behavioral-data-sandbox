# Behavioral Data Sandbox 🧠📊

**Exploring the intersection of Code, Economics, and Human Psychology.**

This repository serves as a testing ground for **Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS)** concepts. It contains scripts and notebooks designed to simulate behavioral theories and analyze market psychology through quantitative data.

## 📂 Modules & Experiments

### 1. `simulation.py`: The Nudge Theory Simulator
A Python script simulating a behavioral A/B test based on **Thaler’s Nudge Theory** and **Loss Aversion**.
* **Objective:** To model how subtle UI changes ("Nudges") impact user decision-making and conversion rates.
* **Key Concepts:** Probability distribution, Control vs. Treatment groups, Synthetic data generation for behavioral auditing.

### 2. `Crypto_Market_Analysis.ipynb`: Market Psychology & Volatility
A data analysis notebook examining Bitcoin (BTC-USD) price action not as a financial asset, but as a proxy for **crowd sentiment**.
* **Objective:** To visualize market volatility and identify "Fear & Greed" patterns using Moving Averages (SMA-50 vs SMA-200).
* **Tech Stack:** `yfinance` for real-time data, `seaborn`/`matplotlib` for dark-mode visualization.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Yfinance.
